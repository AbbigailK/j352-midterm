  <p> Officials began inspecting the damage of Notre Dame Tuesday. They declared the
  cathedral structurally sound while identifying “some vulnerabilities,” according
  to French Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez. Specifically, the vault and
  gable of the north transept were of concern. Inspectors are also worried about
  structural damage that may be hidden. </p>

  <p> Kirk Martini, a professor at the University of Virginia School of
  Architecture with a doctorate from the University of California at
  Berkeley in structural engineering, said the transept is probably the
  greatest vulnerability. To ensure the structure is stable, additional
  shoring may be necessary after the full extent of the damage is assessed. </p>

  <p> Limestone is a key building element of the structure, and stone is
  susceptible to damage from heat and water. “There may have been some damage
  to the stone, even the places that currently appear to be intact . . .
  because of the weaknesses of the material,” Martini said.
  “That’s a big unknown. . . . I don’t think anybody knows the extent of
  that damage.” </p>

  <p>French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the country can rebuild Notre
  Dame within five years. With the scale of the project, Martini is skeptical
  that timeline will be met, even with the number of resources being promised
  for restoration. Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been pledged for the
  rebuilding efforts. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/16/yesterday-

  <p> How the cathedral will be restored is also up for debate.
  On Wednesday, Prime Minister Édouard Philippe announced an international
  competition to replace the iconic spire that collapsed into Monday’s blaze.

      <p> Notre Dame is of geographic and cultural importance to Paris.
        It sits purposefully near the center of the city on a small island surrounded
        by the Seine River. It is also the landmark next to which all other Parisian
        monuments are measured. </p>

  <p> Martin Moeller, senior curator for the National Building Museum
      in Washington, said it is not coincidental that Notre Dame is one of the most
      famous Gothic churches. “The plaza in front of the cathedral was built
      specifically to give a good viewing point,” he said. “It's not an accident
      that so many people have taken photographs of the front of the church.” </p>

  <p> There is already a debate brewing about how the church should
  be restored. Whether the efforts will include building materials similar
  to destroyed in the fire or more modern materials will be up for more discussion
  once officials fully assess the damage, to the building and to its artifacts. </p>

  <p> Much of the art and relics were saved from the flames.
  The cathedral’s large stained-glass windows appear to be
  undamaged, and there’s a strong case for restoring the famed
  structure as closely as possible to its former glory. </p>

  <p> Even the White House offered assistance in the rehabilitation
  of the cathedral. While Notre Dame is revered around the world,
  Moeller stressed the importance of considering how other catastrophic fires
  of major landmarks are handled.

  <p> In St. Landry Parish, La., three black churches burned down from arson
  within 10 days in late March and early April. Before Monday, a GoFundMe for
  the churches had raised just below $50,000 in rebuilding aid. After a Twitter
  campaign urged people to remember the Louisiana churches amidst the
  devastation of Notre Dame, the total skyrocketed to $1 million by Wednesday.

  <p> “Obviously it's one of most famous buildings in the world,” Moeller said of
  Notre Dame. “But we want to make sure that people remember that there are
  other buildings that are important to other communities. It may not be as
  famous, but when tragedy strikes there it can be devastating to a particular
  community or a particular group of people, and sometimes it doesn't get the
  attention it deserves.” </p>
